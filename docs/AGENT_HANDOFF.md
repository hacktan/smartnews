# SmartNews - Agent Handoff

> Canonical handoff doc for the next agent.

## 1) Current Production State

- Pipeline: GitHub Actions cron every 6 hours (`.github/workflows/pipeline.yml`) is active.
- DB persistence: DuckDB file is persisted in GitHub Releases (`db-latest` asset: `smartnews.duckdb`).
- API: Live on Render.
  - URL: `https://smartnews-api.onrender.com`
  - Health: `/health`
- Frontend: Live on Vercel (project deployed and reachable).
  - Note: exact aliased URL can change per Vercel settings; check Vercel dashboard for canonical domain.

## 2) What Is Implemented

- DuckDB migration is complete (pipeline + API).
- Claim extraction pipeline exists: `pipeline/04b_claim_extraction.py`.
- Claims API exists: `GET /api/story/{story_id}/claims`.
- Story detail page consumes claims and renders verification section.
- Full-text quality gates were added in serving projection to reduce low-quality cards:
  - filters require non-empty title
  - `has_full_text = TRUE`
  - minimum full text length guard
- Workflow features:
  - manual trigger (`workflow_dispatch`) with `skip_scraping` and `skip_enrichment`
  - concurrency lock (`group: pipeline`)
  - scraping step can fail without stopping entire run (`continue-on-error: true`)
  - step summary output in GitHub Actions

## 3) Pipeline Run Order (Do Not Change)

```bash
uv run python pipeline/01_bronze_ingestion.py
uv run python pipeline/01b_fulltext_scraping.py
uv run python pipeline/02_silver_transformation.py
uv run python pipeline/03_gold_aggregation.py
uv run python pipeline/04_ai_enrichment.py
uv run python pipeline/03b_story_matching.py
uv run python pipeline/04b_claim_extraction.py
uv run python pipeline/04_ai_enrichment.py
uv run python pipeline/05_serving_projection.py
uv run python pipeline/validate.py
```

## 4) Local LLM Mode (Claim Extraction)

`pipeline/04b_claim_extraction.py` supports local OpenAI-compatible providers.

Recommended with RTX 3060 Ti:

```bash
CLAIM_LLM_PROVIDER=local
CLAIM_MODEL=qwen2.5:7b-instruct
LOCAL_OPENAI_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1
LOCAL_OPENAI_API_KEY=ollama
```

Then run:

```bash
uv run python pipeline/04b_claim_extraction.py
```

## 5) Known Risks / Open Items

- User reported frontend quality regressions (blank titles in Top Stories, some pages still showing RSS-like summaries instead of full-text-backed content).
- Need another end-to-end product validation pass after latest pipeline run:
  - pipeline validation
  - API smoke
  - frontend smoke on live routes
- `docs/PRODUCT_VALIDATIONS.md` is legacy/stale (contains old Databricks-era checks). Keep for reference only or archive/update.

## 6) First Tasks For Next Agent (Priority)

1. Run fresh pipeline (or trigger workflow) and verify `pipeline/validate.py` passes.
2. Inspect live homepage/story pages for blank-title or summary regressions.
3. If regressions exist, patch serving queries in `pipeline/05_serving_projection.py` and rerun projection + validation.
4. Update `docs/VALIDATIONS.md` with exact commands/results from this verification pass.
5. Keep this file and `docs/LEARNINGS.md` updated as source of truth.

## 7) Important File Map

- Pipeline core: `pipeline/`
- Validation script: `pipeline/validate.py`
- Claim extraction: `pipeline/04b_claim_extraction.py`
- Serving projection: `pipeline/05_serving_projection.py`
- API app: `api/`
- Frontend app: `frontend/`
- Operational docs: `docs/VALIDATIONS.md`, `docs/LEARNINGS.md`, `docs/AGENT_HANDOFF.md`

## 8) Guardrails

- Do not commit `.env`, `.mcp.json`, or `smartnews.duckdb`.
- API must read from `serve.*` tables only.
- Always run `uv run python ...` for pipeline scripts.
- After schema/serve changes, run `uv run python pipeline/validate.py`.

## 9) Handoff Checklist

- [x] Repo is on `main`
- [x] Handoff doc updated to current production state
- [x] Click-tracker fallback API URL updated to Render
- [ ] Next agent to run full live validation pass and document outcomes
